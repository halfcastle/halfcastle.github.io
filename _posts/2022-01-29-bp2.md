## Web Scraping on IMDB! ##

In this blog post, I will create a list of recommended movies based on the number of shared actors there are with my favorite movie.

The link to my github repo for this blog post is https://github.com/halfcastle/crawly

First, we need to intialize our project by opening the terminal in the location of the github repository and enter the following:

```console
conda activate PIC16B
scrapy startproject IMDB_scraper
cd IMDB_scraper

```

I have also entered the following line in settings.py in my IMDB_scraper folder to keep the number of pages the spider downloads at 20.

```
CLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT = 20
```

### And now it's time to write the actual scraper!

First, create a file called imdb_spider.py in the spiders directory. This will be where our spider lives!

Importing the scrapy package, and initializing the scraper by giving it a name (for use when we actually run it in the terminal!) and telling it where to go (the url of your favorite movie).


```python
import scrapy

class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11032374/']
```

The movie I chose is Demon Slayer: Mugen Train. 

### Implementing 3 parsing methods

The first place our spider goes is the movie page (our start_urls), where it then navigates itself to the Cast & Crew page.


```python
def parse(self,response):
    """
    Starting on the movie page -> navigates to the Cast & Crew page
    Then calls the function parse_full_credits
    """
    cast_url = response.urljoin("fullcredits")
    #obtains url of the cast page
    yield scrapy.Request(cast_url, callback = self.parse_full_credits)
    #we are now on the cast url, and we now call the next function while on this page
```

The next function, parse_full_credits, allows our scraper to access the pages for each actor in the movie. Using list comprehension, we are able to mimic the process of clicking on each actor's headshots.

If you look closey at the actor link using dev tools, you'll see that the link is just a letter "a". We need to select something more specific, hence we look at the tag on the photo which is "td.primary_photo". We select the "a" from there, then by extracting the href attribute from the "a" element, we're able to get the link to each actor's individual pages. 


```python
def parse_full_credits(self,response):
    """
    Starting on the Cast & Crew page
    Navigates to the page of each actor listed on the page
    """
    for actor in [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]:
        actor_url = response.urljoin(actor)
        yield scrapy.Request(actor_url, callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```

The last function will obtain the movies each actor was a part of. 

It will yield a dictionary that contains all actor names our scraper found and their respective movies.


```python
def parse_actor_page(self,response):
    """
    Starting on an actor's page,
    Yields a dictionary containing actor name and movie name
    """
    actor_name = response.css("span.itemprop::text").get()
    movie_list = response.css("b a::text").getall()
    #obtains all elements with this tag
    for movie in movie_list:
        yield{
            "Actor Name" : actor_name,
            "Movie" : movie
        }
```

Now it's time to run our scraper! Type the following into terminal:

```
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv

```

This results inn a csv file called results. Mine is called "resultss" because I was playing with different movies and saved multiple csvs.

We can now take a look at our results! (in jupyter notebook)


```python
results = pd.read_csv("resultss.csv")
```


```python
results.head(5)
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>Actor Name</th>
      <th>Movie</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Ray Chase</td>
      <td>X-Men '97</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Ray Chase</td>
      <td>Blade Runner: Black Lotus</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Ray Chase</td>
      <td>Halo Infinite</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>Ray Chase</td>
      <td>Licorice Pizza</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Ray Chase</td>
      <td>Shin Megami Tensei V</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



We want our data to look like

*Movie name | Number of shared actors*

so we'll do some pandas. 


```python
import pandas as pd
```

The values.counts() method returns the number of unique values under "Movies". It also very nicely sorts our table in descending order.


```python
new = results["Movie"].value_counts().rename_axis("Movie").reset_index(name="Number of Shared Actors")
```


```python
new.head(15)
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }

As expected, the top movies (shows) are also part of the Demon Slayer series, and they're all anime.

There are so many voice actors in Demon Slayer that I look up to as an aspiring voice actor. :')
